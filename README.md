# 3D-Design

A great design skill I have learned through working on this project is visualization. I followed a simple design process of comparing a digital image to my 3D creation. These strategies could be applied to future work by encouraging detailed working while also being able to visualize the overall goal of a project. 

New development strategies I learned while working would be how to create objects in a 3D space. Iteration played a big role in bringing this project to life, Working with many different objects requires frequent testing, if there is a mistake, you want to know where it happens and why. Iteration makes this process alot easier. I would say developing incrementally is a skill that was forced to be improved by the completion of this project.

Computational graphics and visualizations gives me new knowledge and skills that can be applied to any future career as well as the rest of my degree program. This topic promotes critical thinking. It allows you to work in a very detailed manner, yet forces you to keep the finished product fresh in your mind. It's difficult to get stuck on small details because everything has a place and purpose.
